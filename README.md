# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
⭐🐍This python project implements a handwritten digit recognition application using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras. The application allows users to draw digits on a canvas ✍️, which are then recognized by the trained model 🤖✨. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits 🧑‍🎨
